v4.4

- Re-add previously removed optimisation that toyed with animation conflicts. It's better with it than without it
- Add in an `isShaking` to GeoEntity rendering, in-line with vanilla's LivingEntityRenderer#isShaking
- Improved GeoEntity shouldShowName implementation to better match vanilla's modernised implementations, supporting teams and other conditions
